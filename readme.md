# The security course from Zigexn L&D team

## Other notes

[Note when reading the book](./reading_book.md)

## Structure

This course is divided into 4 sections

1. Network
2. Gaining access
3. Post exploitation
4. Web hacking

## Hacking lab

We setup a lab to practice hacking. The lab contains 3 OSes: windows, kali
linux, and metasploitable. We use VMs.

Windows one will acts as the victim here.

The kali one acts as the hacker. It's a debian-based preinstalled a lot of
tools useful for hackers.

The Metasploitable is a vulnerable linux distro, so this is another victim.

## On warp terminal

I hate the fact that this course suggests using this terminal emulator. The
concept of letting an LLM have access to your shell is really terrible. And
this is a **security** course.

I refuse to use it.
