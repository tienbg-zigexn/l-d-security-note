# Note when reading the book

The author of this book is just teaching and writing books. He does not do
real works. I am getting a hard time convince myself to read.

I read the third edition by the way, not the second.

## Terminologies

- Asset: Anything that has values.
    - Tangible: servers, computers, network devices, etc.
    - Intangible: plan, data, software, intellectual properties, etc.
    - People: customers, employees, personal identity information, etc.
    - Threat: anything that has potentials to cause harm, damage to a asset.
    - Vulnerability: security weaknesses or flaw in the system (most
      significant is human errors).
    - Exploit: tool, code or anything that takes advantage of security
      vulnerabilities.
    - Attack: method, technique to exploit a weakness.
    - Attack vector: area or pathway.
        - Direct access
        - Wireless
        - Email
        - Supply chain
            (this reminds me of the latest npm supply chain attack. Just this
            one maintainer who got tricked by a phishing email and causes
            indirect harm to a bunch of people through dependencies hell. This
            incident shows me how bad the node modules or node ecosystem is,
            and auto update is a terrible thing.)
        - Social media
        - Removable media (The auto run from Windows, I have seen too many.)
        - Cloud
    - Risk: the potential impact or the likelihood of an attack, threat,
      vulnerability.
    - Attack surface: vulnerable *entry* points.
    - **Zero-day**: a security vulnerability that the vendor hasn't aware or
      developed a patch.

(I just notice that the author is using a lot of empty words. We can remove a
bunch of paragraphs without losing any meaning.)

## Threat actors

Script kiddie: Someone who does not fully understand the technical details of
cybersecurity to perform or develop a threat on their own. They are not
harmless, by following instructions, tutorials from malicious real hackers,
they can do equal harm or even worse.

Cyber terrorist: They target societies, they have ideological goals.

Hacktivist: (Reminds me of the 'V for Vendetta' movie.)

Insider: (Intel chipset has hardware-based back-doors, from Intel.)

State-sponsored: (Oh, China) The author is using fancy words again to describe
the basic concept that has existed through the whole history, **spy**. I am
laughing: reconnaissance, intelligence gathering.

Organized crime: Crime organizations are groups of expert people or have
specialized skill set, like a lawyer. With this level of efforts and resources,
their goals are big.

Black hat: Malicious goals.

White hat: Help people.

Gray hat: (Mr. Robot)
