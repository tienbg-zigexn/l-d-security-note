# Note when reading the book

The author of this book is just teaching and writting books. He does not do
real works. I am getting a hard time convince myself to read.

## Terminologies

- Asset: Anything that has values.
    - Tangible: servers, computers, network devices, etc.
    - Intangible: plan, data, softwares, intellectual properties, etc.
    - People: customers, employees, personal identity information, etc.
    - Threat: anything that has potentials to cause harm, damage to a asset.
    - Vulnerability: security weaknesses or flaw in the system (most
      significant is human errors).
    - Exploit: tool, code or anything that takes advantage of security
      vulnerabilities.
    - Attack: method, technique to exploit a weakness.
    - Attack vector: area or pathway.
        - Direct access
        - Wireless
        - Email
        - Supply chain
            (this reminds me of the latest npm supply chain attack. Just this
            one maintainer who got tricked by a phishing email and causes
            indirect harm to a bunch of people through dependencies hell. This
            incident shows me how bad the node modules or node ecosystem is,
            and auto update is a terrible thing.)
        - Social media
        - Removable media (The autorun from Windows, I have seen too many.)
        - Cloud
    - Risk: the potential impact or the likelihood of an attack, threat,
      vulnerability.
    - Attack surface: vulnerable *entry* points.
    - **Zero-day**: a security vulnerability that the vendor hasn't aware or
      developed a patch.

(I just notice that the author is using a lot of empty words. We can remove a
bunch of paragraphs without losing any meaning.)
